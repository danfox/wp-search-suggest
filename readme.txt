Provides title suggestions while typing a search query, using the built in jQuery suggest script.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you provide the user with search suggestions based on the information entered in the search field.

It adds an AJAX call to the search form, returning matches for the current search query from the database.
There is no change of template files necessary as this plugin hooks in the existing WordPress API to unfold its magic.
